    <h1>the ant and the cicada</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a hot hot summer, and a cicada that didn't like sweating or struggling. The only thing she liked to do was sing all day.

        Under the branch of the tree where the cicada lay comfortably, an ant passed back and forth, all busy carrying a lot of things on its back: bits of food, pebbles, sticks, etc.
        The cicada, seeing how sweaty the ant was, began to tease her: - Come up here with me, lady ant. It's cooler, and while you rest, we sing a few songs together - and, as she said it, she began to sing.
        - Thank you very much for the invitation, lady cicada, but I am very busy putting away provisions for the winter and arranging my little house to protect myself from the cold when it comes - and, saying so, she kept pacing back and forth for the meadow, busy.
        - But the summer is still long - continued the cicada - and the winter is still far away. Don't worry now, there will be time later to store the supplies!
        
        The ant shook his head a little and continued her work undaunted, no longer paying attention to the cicada.
        - Do as you like, my ant. Meanwhile, I enjoy this wonderful day staying here relaxed to rest - and the cicada resumed singing another song.
        But the days and then the months passed quickly, and here, on time, winter arrived, with its cold and ice.
        The cicada wandered through the fields and meadows, struggling as best she could, picking up something to eat here and there and sheltering from the cold wherever it happened.
        Wandering wandering, one evening when darkness had fallen very early, she encountered a small house with a lighted window. The cicada was so hungry and so cold, so she knocked on the door.
        The door opened and the ant came out. That was her little house built with difficulty throughout the summer, from the inside you could feel a nice warmth and a very inviting smell of food.
        
        - Good evening lady cicada, what brings you here to me?
        - Good evening ant lady - answered the cicada all cold, trembling in the light coat she was wearing. - I'm cold, I'm hungry and I don't have a roof to spend the night.
        
        The ant looked at the cicada with compassion.
        - Ah lady cicada, as I well remember the hot summer days when, while I was struggling to put away provisions and build a house, you, blessed on your branch in the cool and shade, sang, sang and sang ... Well, let's do like this: come in, this time I will help you and give you something to eat and a bed to sleep on. But you promise that next summer you'll help me get some supplies.
        The cicada, having learned the lesson, promised that she would do her good and heartily thanked the ant for her help.
        
        Moral: whoever does nothing, gets nothing, that's why we must commit ourselves.</p>
